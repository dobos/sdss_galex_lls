Sandor: LLS fitting
- check how many lines of the series are used, can this number be increased if necessary?
- test line blending by varying velocity dispersion
- vdisp should be small

Barbara: We need to upgrade plots:
- emission line names (Mg, Si, C etc.)
- add z and name of object, SNR
- cut above 9200 AA
- scale y axis manually to get rid of peaks from noise
	- could use histogram technique (cut at 10%)
	- or order flux values and cut at quantiles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile
- plot error on the bottom in red, and not as +/- around the flux, which one is better when looking at fits?

Krisztian: merge files into a single database of objects

Gerry: send info on stsci student programs
