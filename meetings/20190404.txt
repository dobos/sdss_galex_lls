Kriszti치n:
  try to find missing files
  in Galex, not all of them are reduced in the xg version

Everyone:
  - plot SDSS QSO spectra with high resolution, multiple lines
  - plot Galex spectra with dynamic y-axis scaling
  - maybe omit noisy parts of Galex spectra entirely in plots
  - maybe apply low pass filter (moving average)
  - play around with filtering, try to emphasize narrow absorption lines
