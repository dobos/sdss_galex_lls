1. Stack lines of absorvers?

It’s been done for SDSS: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850..156L

We can do the same but add GALEX for our sample of 1300 quasars,
to get a better idea of metallicities.
Having the HI lines should be VERY helpful!

Fit stacked lines with cloudy
Stack spectra of absorbers in high-metallicity/low-metallicity groups

Can we stack different lines of the same ion of _same_ absorber to get higher SNR?

2. Look at the Ly series in the Galex spectra

Could get an upper limit on HI column density from Ly series
Can use these limits as prior in LLS fitting or use in addition to LLS fitting
Ly lines might be saturated, no way to tell from low-res Galex spectra

3. Krisztián will compile a jupyter notebook

Specify SDSS ID, generate diagnostic plots, print all available info on system
Allow for tuning LLS fit manually
