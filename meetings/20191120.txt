Discussed refractory elements, latest line list
-- about 15 lines to check for each of 30 quasars

Bob Carswell offered to use vpfit to measure the HI column densities (with [big] error bars)

Laszlo - checking code with Krisztian
check metal lines with Gaussian and also straight integration methods
-- Gaussians are easily distorted in the case of weak lines with noise

G: Assume a small b-value for metal lines, maybe bound with a low and high values, say 3 and 10 km/s,
but it depends a bit on the mass of the atom for the element in question.
Usually there is a mix of thermal and turbulent motion, but turbulent motion >10 km/s is rare,
>30 km/s is unknown in my experience.

Try to get line measurements done in a first version by Christmas.

Jozsef Vinko recommended  Sandor Frey as a local contact in Budapest for Sandor.
